Hey there! I don't know why you're bothering to look at this repository, but since you're here I'll answer a few questions:

-----[ What is this for? ]----

Initially I've been making small coding projects here and there and eventually began teaching myself the stuff people use to make websites, so I was like "I should keep track of everything I made onto a website so I could show it off to people". I did some digging around and here now we have this thing here.

-----[ So...it's a portfolio? ]----

Pretty much, yeah. Plus, it's a good learning experience and I can host future shenanigans on it, also.

-----[ Why isn't there a whole lot on here, then? ]----

it's not done lol.
In all seriousness, though, it IS still in it's early stages and has a lot to be added, but I need a way to test functions on mobile devices, so please be patient.
