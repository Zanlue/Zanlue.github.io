Hey there! I don't know why you're bothering to look at this repository, but since you're here I'll get right to the chase:

## Prologue

One day, I was messing around with CSS on Reddit until I got the brilliant idea to litter my desktop with html files that would soon evolve into this hunk-of-junk website that I made using my newfound skills. The end.

## The purpose of this website

Pretty much the same purpose for almost any website hosted through Github Pages: hosting blog posts and a portfolio of works I wanna show to people.

Every now and then I might experiment with a few things and have them hosted on there as well.

## And...?

That's all I have to say about it, really, unless you're some recruiter then most of this wouldn't mean much to you.
